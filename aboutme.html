 		<strong> Prep for Prep </strong>

 		<br>
 		<br>

 		In 5th grade, I applied for a program called Prep for Prep. I was accepted and joined Contingent XXVI. Prep for Prep is a highly selective leadership program for bright students of color. Through a 14-month intensive, I was academically prepared to enter an independent school. I was able to make great connections with students and teachers. To this day, I continue to give back to the Prep community by being part of the admissions commitee, which helps arrange materials for testing days of future Prep generations.

 		<strong> The Chapin School </strong>

 		<br>
 		<br>

Starting 6th grade, I entered The Chapin School. The Chapin School is an independent day school located on the Upper East Side for students K-12. At Chapin, I am able to participate in a variety of clubs as well as pursue personal projects. For example, I am a writer at my schools newspaper, Limelight. On the right is the picture of the magazine cover.
